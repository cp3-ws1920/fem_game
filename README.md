# fem_game

A very simple game I made in Godot to demonstrate the capabilities of [ElasticBody2D](https://github.com/cp3-ws1920/elastic_body_2d), a module for [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) that uses a [fnite element solver](https://github.com/cp3-ws1920/fem_solver) to calculate elastic deformations of game objects.

The aim is to break the crystal with the small sphere by using the elastic slingshots. Drag the slingshots with the mouse.

Binaries can be found at the [releases page](https://github.com/john-wigg/fem_game/releases).
